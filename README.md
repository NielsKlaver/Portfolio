# Portfolio

This public repo contains my portfolio with Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for hobby and self learning purposes. I completed the DataQuest Data Scientist and Data Analist path and several other courses . All can be found in this folder:  [Certificates](https://github.com/NielsKlaver/Portfolio/tree/master/Certificates). 

This portfolio will be updated on a regular basis.
