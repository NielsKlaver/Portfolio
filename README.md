# Portfolio

This public repo contains my portfolio with Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for hobby and self learning purposes. I completed the DataQuest Data Scientist and Data Analist path and several other courses . All can be found in this folder:  [Certificates](https://github.com/NielsKlaver/Portfolio/tree/master/Certificates). 

This portfolio will be updated on a regular basis.

## Projects

All projects will be presented in Jupiter notebook format.


### Machine Learning

[__Building a SMS Spamfilter Naive Bayes__]()In this project we build a spam filter for SMS messages.We construct a dictionary to calculate probabilities and use Naive Bayes for classification <br>__Skills: Classification, Naive Bayes, Pandas , Regular Expressions__

### Data Cleaning

[__Clean and analyze exit surveys__](https://github.com/NielsKlaver/public_projects/blob/master/Clean%20And%20Analyze%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys/Exit%20survey%20analysis.ipynb) In this project we clean and analyze 2 exit surveys on why employees resigned. The datasets contain a lot of inconsistencies that need our attention before we can combine and compare.<br> __Skills: Pandas, Regular Expressions, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Visualization__

[__Search for profitable app profiles__](https://github.com/NielsKlaver/public_projects/blob/master/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets/app_store.ipynb)  In this project we analyze Google Playstore and the Apple iOS stor for profitable app profiles.<br>__Skills: Data cleaning, Data Analysis__

### Algorithms 

[__Building fast search queries on a .csv file__](https://github.com/NielsKlaver/public_projects/blob/master/Building%20Fast%20Queries%20on%20Inventory%20CSV/Building%20Fast%20Queries%20on%20a%20CSV.ipynb ) In this project I build a custom inventory class for Inventory lookup and implemented binary search and reduced time complexity.<br>
__Skills: Object Oriented Programming, Algorithms__

### SQL

[__Music Store Business Questions__](https://github.com/NielsKlaver/public_projects/blob/master/Answering%20Music%20Store%20%20Business%20Questions%20using%20SQL/Answering%20Business%20Questions%20with%20SQL.ipynb) In this project we try to find new opportunities for our online music store. We use advances SQL joins and filters to answer these.<br>
__Skills: SQL, Data Analysis__

[__Analyzing CIA Factbook Data__](https://github.com/NielsKlaver/public_projects/blob/master/Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20Using%20SQL/%20Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20Using%20Python%20%2B%20SQL.ipynb) In this project we connect to a SQL database and run SQL Queries to analyze the data.<br>__Skills: SQL, Data Analysis__
