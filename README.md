# Portfolio


This public repo contains my Portfolio with Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for hobby and self learning purposes. 

I completed several courses on different platforms which can be found in this folder:  [Certificates](https://github.com/NielsKlaver/Portfolio/tree/master/Certificates)

This portfolio will be updated on a regular basis.
